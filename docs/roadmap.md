# Readiness Roadmap

The canonical roadmap lives at the repository root (see
[ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/UBC-FRESH/nemora/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)). It is mirrored here for
convenience once the documentation build pipeline is wired to sync top-level planning artefacts.

```{warning}
This page is a placeholder and will be replaced with an automated include of the repository
roadmap once the docs build pipeline is finalised.
```
